# Summary
This article discusses the mistake made by Citibank that caused them to accidentally send $500 million to creditors. While acting as an agent for Revlon, Citibank intended to send interest payments of $7.8 million to creditors. However, a misinterpretation of a software called Flexcube caused an employee to accidentally send the full $900 million principal of the loan to creditors. I found the article interesting because it demonstrates the importance of designing user interfaces that are clear and easy to use. With an improved interface, the employee would have better understood where they were sending the money and would have been less likely to make this mistake. Overall, it is important to ensure that interfaces are designed clearly so that the user understands how the software is used, and to avoid any unintended consequences.
